# 🔍Dataset Overview

<p align="center"> <img src="assets/comparison.jpg" width="90%"></p>

Remote sensing (RS) images have become essential for monitoring and understanding human environments, driving advancements in applications like precision agriculture, urban planning, and disaster assessment. While recent studies have proposed benchmarks and metrics to assess MLLM performance in RS, these efforts remain limited in image size, annotation method and evaluation dimensions.
​We present XLRS-Bench, **a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs in ultra-high-resolution RS scenarios,** featuring the largest average image size of **8,500 × 8,500** observed thus far. Our dataset encompasses **45,942 annotations across 16 tasks**, all expertly curated by a team of 45 experts. The main advantages of XLRS-Bench compared to existing MLLM benchmarks as follows:

1. **Ultra-high Resolution.** XLRS-Bench features the largest image sizes available, **10∼20×** than that of existing datasets, with 840 images out of all images at a resolution of **10,000×10,000** pixels
2. **High-quality Annotation.** All the annotations are human involved and manually verified through iterations, resulting in a high-quality benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on real ultra-high-resolution RS scenarios.
3. **Comprehensive Evaluation Dimensions:** XLRS-Bench covers 10 perception indicators and 6 reasoning dimensions to assess MLLMs’ capabilities, encompassing **16 sub-tasks with a total of 45,942** questions. Especially, XLRS-Bench includes complex reasoning tasks to explore MLLMs’ potential in conducting planning and change detection in long spatial-temporal RS scenarios.
